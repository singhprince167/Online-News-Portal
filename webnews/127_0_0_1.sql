Typically, you could play games only after installing the app from Play Store first.\r\n*\r\nSome of the games included in the Play Store collection are Clash Royale, Words with Friends, Solitaire, Mighty Battles and more. However, please note that you will not be given the entire game to play.\r\n*\r\n Jonathan Karmel told TechRadar that only a smaller version of the app can be played with Instant gameplay.\r\n*\r\nGoogle is changing the way we use our phones. The company launched Google Instant apps in year 2016. Similar to Instant gameplay, it allows you to try out apps first without having to install them first.\r\n*\r\nWith Instant apps, you can run apps on your Android phone without installing them first.\r\n*\r\nGoogle is also focussing on users who can\'t afford to buy a costly smartphone. The company launched Android Go OS to give a smart OS experience on entry-level phones.\r\n*\r\n Google\'s Android Go is basically for entry-level phones. The company last month also launched lightweight Google assistant to work on its Android Go OS. The company also has Go apps that are compatible with the OS. These apps consume less space and are less data hungry.\r\n*\r\nNow users can also access Google Assistant on Android Go. Users who have Android Go and apps running on their phone can ask Google voice assistant now. However, not all apps have been designed to support the assistant presently. *\r\nThe Google Assistant, for now supports smart home devices, reminders and Actions on Android Go.

The Vivo V9 looks a lot like a certain phone from a certain company that shares its name with a fruit that apparently keeps doctors away, both inside and out. But while that will cost you close to a lakh, you can get Vivo V9 for Rs 22,990.\r\n*\r\nThe V9, which seems to be a successor to the V7 that was launched in India in November last year, is a phone banking heavily on design and camera capabilities. Here\'s a closer look at the Vivo V9.\r\n*\r\nSpecifications:\r\n\r\nProcessor: The Vivo V9 is powered by a 2.2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 processor clubbed with Adreno 506GPU.\r\n*\r\nRAM: 4GB\r\n\r\nInternal storage: The Vivo V9 comes with 64GB of internal storage which is further expandable by up to 256GB via a dedicated micro-SD card slot.\r\n*\r\nScreen: The Vivo V9 comes with a 6.3-inch IPS LCD display with a full-HD+ resolution (2280x1080) and curved 2.5D glass (unspecified) on the front. Vivo is also offering a free screen guard that comes pre-installed on the V9.\r\n*\r\nRear camera: The Vivo V9 comes with a dual camera system on the rear consisting of a primary 16-megapixel sensor with f/2.0 aperture and a 5-megapixel secondary sensor for depth sensing to enable portrait photos. The dual camera system further comes with phase detection autofocus and LED flash. The V9 can shoot 4K videos.\r\n*\r\nFront camera: On the front, the V9 comes with a whopping 24-megapixel camera with screen flash (selfie light). The front camera can record 1080p videos.\r\n\r\nSoftware: The V9 runs Android 8.1 Oreo-based Funtouch OS 4.0 which is Vivo\'s custom skin.\r\n\r\nBattery: The Vivo V9 is backed by a 3,260mAh battery and includes a 10W charger in the box.\r\n*\r\nSpecial features:\r\n\r\n-- The most striking aspect of the V9 is its design even though some may say that Vivo has taken it a little too far this time. \r\n*\r\nThe V9 looks remarkably like Apple\'s premium flagship iPhone X, especially from the front. But while the iPhone X costs almost a lakh to own, the the Vivo V9 costs mere peanuts in comparison. Just like the iPhone X the V9 also comes with a near edge-to-edge screen with a notch up-top. \r\n*\r\nThe notch allows Vivo to offer a screen-to-body ratio of almost a 90 per cent even though the V9 has a slight chin at the bottom, something that the iPhone X is lacking.\r\n*\r\n-- The notch on-board the V9 ships sans any fancy hardware and houses just the earpiece, the selfie camera, an LED notification light, and regular sensors. The notch that\'s on-board the iPhone X comes with dedicated hardware to enable Face ID, a form of recognition, that\'s touted as fast and secure.\r\n*\r\n The V9, for the record, also supports face unlock but it\'s nothing like Face ID, and Vivo itself warns users it isn\'t as secure as a fingerprint scanner.\r\n\r\n*\r\n-- The Vivo V9 has a plastic body and has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner and micro-USB for charging and data syncing. It\'s quite attractive to look at, the V9, and also it\'s ridiculously light. It measures 7.89mm in thickness and weighs in at 150 gram. \r\n*\r\nThe back has a matte glossy finish to it that sort of eases into the front something that enhances ergonomics. Vivo seems to have done a good job here: the V9 is a large phone on paper, but, pint-sized to hold and operate.\r\n*\r\n-- The Vivo V9 has an unusually tall screen and an unusual aspect ratio of 19:9. Vivo calls it Full View.\r\n\r\n-- Vivo is banking heavily on artificial intelligence to sell its new phone. The V9, it says, comes with AI Smart Engine to boost the phone\'s performance over time through smart storage management and app launching based on user behaviour. \r\n*\r\nThe V9, in addition, comes with AI Face Access that\'s touted to improve the accuracy of the face unlock feature, and AI Attention Sensing that can apparently recognize when the user is looking at the screen and reduces the volume of notifications accordingly.\r\n*\r\n-- The dual camera system on the V9 can help capture portrait shots or photos with blurry background. A feature called shot refocus will allow users to adjust the bokeh post taking a shot while ultra HDR will allow the dual camera system to take three images of a shot, then superimpose them, to result in supposedly clearer photos with better contrast and saturation.\r\n*\r\n-- Vivo says, the V9 cameras are enhanced by AI. The selfie camera, in particular, supports AI Face Beauty that, according to Vivo, uses machine learning to identify users\' age, sex and skin tone to aid in supposedly better selfies. Both the front as well as the rear cameras also support live stickers, much on the lines of what Samsung has been offering for some time now.\r\n*\r\nPrice and availability:\r\n\r\nThe Vivo V9 will be available for buying in Pearl Black, Champagne Gold and Sapphire Blue colour options offline and online exclusively from Amazon India from April 2 with pre-orders beginning from Friday itself at a price of Rs 22,990.\r\n\r\n                  ', '1', '2018-03-24', '2020-01-01 14:42:12', 'Active'),

The smell of polished wood; the dim-lit stage, the swirling dust? When Naina Mathur (Rani Mukerji) – once student, now teacher – returns to St. Notkers, she finds her memories invaded.\r\n*\r\n The auditorium, visibly worn out, now serves as a hideout for the rascals of ‘9F’.  They smoke bidis, deal out cards, flip through fashion magazines and occasionally break out in freestyle rap. \r\n*\r\nNaina has been tasked to handle this bunch, shepherd them through the mid-terms. \"Haklati hain? (she hiccups?)\" laughs one of the punksters, amused by the peculiar condition of their new teacher. “Bet she\'ll scoot in a day...” another throws in a 20.\r\n*\r\nNaina smiles from a distance. Someone is about to lose his money.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirected and Indianized by Sidharth P. Malhotra, Rani Mukerji\'s Hichki has the sweet bearings of a sunny social drama. It straddles a visible line between a mellow Chak De! India and a breezy Taare Zameen Par, occasionally finding its voice in the smallest of characters.\r\n*\r\n There isn\'t much invention or newness as such (the film is a remake of Peter Werner\'s Front of the Class, which in turn was based on Brad Cohen\'s biographical book on his experiences with Tourette\'s Syndrome), but there are moments that are worth your engagement.\r\n*\r\n What could have become a bland rehash of a ready-to-cook Hollywood script (like last year\'s Chef or Tubelight) is saved and sauced up by some great performances and an on-and-off attachment to realism—‘adhesion’ and ‘cohesion’, as Rani explains in a science class. Sample this: In one of the starting scenes, Naina shuts up a school principal at a job interview for picking on her symptoms – a nervous tic motion of the head followed by quick, guttural sounds – and metaphorically shames him for having a choppy mind.\r\n*\r\n In the next scene, however, we find her lying on a promising phone call by saying...\"Kuch nahi sir, mera kutta bhawnk raha hai...\" (Nothing sir, my dog is barking…).\r\n*\r\nIn all her might and power, Rani Mukerji breezes through her character in Hichki, but the familiarity of terrain – a rebellious woman braving raised eyebrows to heal the world – squeezes out any room for variation, like Christopher Nolan forcing Michael Caine to play a caretaker once again.\r\n*\r\nWhich is why Malhotra’s film banks heavily on the freshness of erstwhile child actor, Harsh Mayar. Remembered best as the kid from I Am Kamal, Harsh, now almost 20, is a rare charmer. \r\n*\r\nHe plays the seemingly-hardened gang leader of ‘9F’, a slum-kid named Aatish, who carries enough redness in his eyes to match the spark in his name.\r\n*\r\n Hair-spiked, shirt tucked out, Aatish watches over his buddies at the school playground, answers arrogance with a punch, and ogles shamelessly at the hot topper girl of \'9A\'. Even at such a fledging age, Harsh pays undivided attention to his character, emoting thoughtfully in every reaction shot but also ducking his head when Rani mentions \'final exams\'.\r\n*\r\n Others in his crew - the overweight rapper, the clueless dim-wit, the lean hustler, the upright Anne Marie - flesh out their parts convincingly well, so does acting maestro Neeraj Kabi as the trim and dapper student council head, Mr. Wadia.\r\n*\r\nPaving multiple textures on a predictable story, Hichki fails to glue it all together with its glib optimism, and blows up in the end like Wadia\'s beloved \'science project\', which Aatish guts in response to an insult.\r\n*\r\n As for the themes of disability and discrimination at the workplace, all of that fades away in the first half and becomes incidental, or at best metaphorical, to the main plot, which is really all about reinforcing the corny adage... ‘There are no bad students, only bad teachers.\'\r\n*\r\nOccupying a spacious weekend and releasing two days after Rani Mukerji\'s 40th birthday, Hichki is a digestible senior-school drama baked to the comforts of its target audience – families and children, teachers and students – and should entertain them thoroughly.\r\n*\r\n In an endless swamp of watery Hollywood reprisals, Hichki stands on its own and underlines with a chalk why...\'there are no bad remakes, only bad filmmakers.\'\r\n\r\n                  ', '0', '2018-03-24', '2018-03-28 13:36:25', 'Active'),

They also asked for money on loan but never returned that to me. I have all evidence of the money transfers.

It contains a combination of two agents that stimulate T cells, a type of immune cell, to attack cancer. Normally, the body\'s T cells recognize cancer cells as abnormal and will infiltrate and attack them. But as a tumor grows, it suppresses the activity of the T cells so that these cells can no longer keep the cancer at bay.\r\n*\r\nThe new treatment works by reactivating these T cells. Researchers inject the \"vaccine\" directly into the tumor. The two agents in the treatment work synergistically in activating the T cells.

The Redmi Note 5 Pro is easily among the best phones that you can buy at under Rs 20,000. It comes with a premium design, a bezel-less display, top-notch hardware and fantastic dual cameras. The Redmi Note 5 Pro also has a battery life to die for.\r\n*\r\nOnly now we have a phone that can give the Redmi Note 5 Pro a thorough run for its money, in almost all the departments. The Nokia 6 2018, from HMD Global, is that phone. The Nokia 6 2018 may not exactly dazzle from a specifications point of view, but, that\'s not something that HMD Global is gunning for, at the end of the day. Instead, the Nokia 6 2018 is relying on the overall experience to woo buyers in India. And that overall experience is something that the company is hoping to offer with three elements: design, the brand appeal -- read nostalgia -- and pure Android.\r\n*\r\n\r\nHere\'s a closer look at the new Nokia 6 2018 and its closest rival, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro.\r\n*\r\n1. The Nokia 6 2018 is an all-metal smartphone -- boasting of 6000 series aluminium -- with chamfered edges and curved 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on the front: much like the original Nokia 6. Only this time round, HMD is using bold colour accents to accentuate the phone\'s chamfers on both the front as well as on the back. The company is also using the same bold colour scheme around the camera module and the fingerprint scanner. Speaking of which, the Nokia 6 2018 now comes with a rear-mounted finger-print scanner and on-screen navigation keys. HMD is also using its bold colour accent scheme around the power button and the volume rocker. Elsewhere, the Nokia 6 2018 comes with USB Type-C port for charging and data syncing. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro meanwhile comes with an almost full-metal body -- with top and bottom ends being plastic with brushed metal finish -- curved 2.5D Corning Gorilla glass (unspecified) with rounded edges and polished antenna lines. Sadly, it comes with a micro-USB 2.0 port, for charging and data syncing.\r\n*\r\n2. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is Xiaomi\'s first mainstream bezel-less phone in India. The company, to recall, also sells the Mi Mix 2 in the country, but that\'s a more premium offering. The Redmi Note 5 Pro brings bezel-less screens to the masses. This allows Xiaomi to increase the screen real estate without increasing the all-round footprint of the phone. The Redmi Note 5 Pro, to that effect, comes with a 5.99-inch \'full-screen\' FHD+ display with a 2160x1080p resolution and 403ppi pixel density. Because Xiaomi has shaved off much of the bezels on the top and bottom and also on the sides, the Redmi Note 5 Pro feels much smaller than regular 6-inch phones. Also, it supports an unusual aspect ratio of 18:9, as against the more traditional 16:9. The Nokia 6 2018 comes with the same 5.5-inch 1080p display with a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio as the original Nokia 6.\r\n*\r\n3. The Nokia 6 2018 is powered by a 2.2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor clubbed with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage which is expandable by up to 128GB via a hybrid micro-SD card slot. The Redmi Note 5 Pro meanwhile is powered by a 1.8GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor clubbed with up to 6GB of RAM and up to 64GB of storage which is further expandable by up to 128GB via a hybrid micro-SD card slot.\r\n*\r\n4. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 runs Android 7.1.1 Nougat (based MIUI 9) out-of-the-box. The Nokia 6 2018 is meanwhile an Android One phone that runs a stock version of Android 8.0 Oreo.\r\n\r\n5. The Redmi Note 5 Pro comes with a dual camera system on the rear consisting of one 12-megapixel sensor with f/2.2 aperture and another 5-megapixel sensor with f/2.0 aperture. Both are RGB. While the primary sensor has a 1.25um size to capture more light, the secondary sensor assists in portrait shots or photos with shallow depth of field. The dual camera system, in the Redmi Note 5 Pro, further comes with phase detection autofocus and a dual-LED (dual-tone) flash. There\'s EIS for videos but videos are capped to 1080p at 30fps. On the front, the Redmi Note 5 Pro, sports a 20-megapixel camera with LED flash. The Nokia 6 2018 ships with the same cameras as last year\'s Nokia 6 which means that it carries a 16-megapixel camera on the rear with f/2.0 aperture, Phase Detection Autofocus and dual-LED flash. On the front, it comes with an 8-megapixel camera. Only this time, HMD is bringing the Nokia 8\'s hallmark feature, aka Dual-Sight (and Bothie), to the masses with the Nokia 6 2018. Dual-Sight, to recall, is a feature that lets a user to simultaneously use both the rear and front cameras to take stills/record videos. The Nokia 6 2018, in addition, allows a user to capture high-fidelity spatial audio as well.\r\n\r\n6. The Redmi Note 5 Pro is backed by a 4,000mAh battery but doesn\'t support fast charging. The Nokia 6 2018 is backed by a smaller 3,000mAh battery. It supports fast charging though.\r\n\r\n7. The Redmi Note 5 Pro starts at Rs 13,999 for the base 4GB RAM and 64GB storage version while the top-end version with 6GB RAM and 64GB storage is available for buying for Rs 16,999. The Nokia 6 2018 is meanwhile priced at Rs 16,999 for the 3GB RAM and 32GB storage option. HMD will be bringing the 4GB RAM and 64GB version to India in the days to come, but we can expect it to be costlier still.\r\n\r\n', '4', '2018-04-05', '2018-04-18 13:03:33', 'Active'),

The next OnePlus phone is likely to launch in May but ahead of the launch a new promotional banner of the phone is doing rounds on some Chinese websites. It reveals -- or rather confirms -- something that people have already guessed at: The OnePlus 6 will also come in a Coral Blue colour.\r\n\r\nAas expected, apart from the top hardware -- similar to what we have seen in the phones like the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S and the Galaxy S9 this year -- the OnePlus 6 will also come with updated OnePlus software called Oxygen OS. This will be lightly modified Android Oreo. Although it will retain the look and feel of stock Android, the new Oxygen OS will likely come with gestures and features similar to those seen in the iPhone X earlier.\r\n*\r\nMeanwhile, a teaser video of the OnePlus 6 has also appeared which too confirms something obvious. The teaser video suggests that the OnePlus 6 will be exclusive to Amazon India as far as the Indian online market is concerned. Though the phone will also be available through OnePlus offline stores and the company\'s offline partners.\r\n*\r\nApart from the new colour, the banner reveals that the OnePlus 6 will come with two cameras on the back, with the primary camera using a 16-megapixel image sensor while the secondary camera using 20-megapixel sensor. The banner also lists some of the information that has already been confirmed by OnePlus. It notes that the OnePlus 6 will come with up to 8GB RAM and up to 256GB internal storage. It will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor. The promotional banner also reveals that the OnePlus 6 will come with improved Dash charging that should help users recharge the battery of the OnePlus 6 even faster than what was possible with the OnePlus 5 or the OnePlus 5T.\r\n*\r\nAhead of the launch, a lot of OnePlus 6 details have been leaked. In fact, just last week the phone\'s full photos were leaked by a case maker. Although the phone was inside cases, some of these cases were transparent, which gave us a fairly good look at the device. The design of the OnePlus 6 is changing compared to that of the OnePlus 5T. The new OnePlus 6 is likely to come with the red slider button that controls the ringing and silent modes. This button is also likely to be used by OnePlus as the button to get focus when the camera app is on. Then there is the placement of the rear dual-cameras in the OnePlus 6. The camera module will be placed in the top middle of the rear cover, unlike on the right edge the way it is in the OnePlus 5T. Also, under the camera module there will be the fingerprint sensor.\r\n*\r\nThe OnePlus 6 is also coming with a screen -- likely to be 6.28 inches -- that has a notch. Although the company has suggested that the users will be able to hide the notch through software settings.\r\n*\r\nThe global launch of the OnePlus 6 is expected in May and there is a chance that the phone should come to India within a few days after the announcement. Basically, India will be among the first countries where the OnePlus 6 will go on sale given the fact that it is the company\'s largest market right now. There is no word on the price, although there is talk that the OnePlus 6 will be slightly more expensive that the OnePlus 5T. This \"slightly\" could be Rs 2,000 to Rs 3000, although the top variant of OnePlus 6 (8GB RAM and 256GB storage) may cost close to Rs 50,000 in India.
